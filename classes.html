<h2>Gentle Hatha Yoga</h2>
<p>Intended for beginners and anyone wishing a grounded
    foundation in the practice of yoga, this 60 minute class of
    poses and slow movement focuses on asana (proper
    alignment and posture), pranayama (breath work), and
    guided meditation to foster your mind and body
    connection.</p>
<h2>Vinyasa Yoga</h2>
<p>Although designed for intermediate to advanced students,
    beginners are welcome to sample this 60 minute class
    that focuses on breath-synchronized movementâ€”you will
    inhale and exhale as you flow energetically through yoga
    poses.</p>
<h2>Restorative Yoga</h2>
<p>This 90 minute class features very slow movement and
    long poses that are supported by a chair or wall. This
    calming, restorative experience is suitable for students of
    any level of experience. This practice can be a perfect
    way to help rehabilitate an injury.
